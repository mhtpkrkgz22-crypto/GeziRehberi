        <p>The construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the <strong>Coliseum</strong>, began around AD 7 under the Emperor Vespasian.
                The Coliseum was built in a valley, having dried a small lake that Nero used for the <strong>Aurea</strong>, between the hills of the Palatine,
                Esquiline and Celio. The Emperor Titus inaugurated the Colosseum in the year 80, but 2 years later finished the works that included the last floor.</p>
        <p>The Colosseum became the largest Roman amphitheater, with an elliptical structure of 188 meters long, 156 meters wide and 57 meters high. Made in brick
                and covered with travertine was divided into five levels with a capacity for more than 50,000 people. Its areas were delimited depending on the social class,
                the closer to the arena they were the greater the rank to which they belonged.</p>
        <p>In the nineteenth century, work was done on the settlement and remodeling of the Coliseum, and although during <strong>World War II</strong> suffered the effects of the attacks,
                this majestic and imposing monument has become a cultural asset of the city and the world surviving the time and wars.</p>

        <p>“The most beautiful relic of ancient Rome, a temple so well preserved that it appears as the Romans must have seen it in their times,”
                so described it the<strong>French writer Stendhal</strong> in the 19th century. A source of inspiration for the greatest architects of all ages, its beauty, the harmony
                of the lines and the perfect geometries have always struck people both in the past and the present.</p>
        <p>The story of one of the best preserved examples of Roman monumental architecture begins in 27 BC, when<strong>Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</strong>,
                a close friend, son-in-law, and lieutenant to Augustus, commissioned a temple in this area dedicated to “all the gods”. The present building is, however,
                the result of the radical reconstruction by <strong>between</strong> 118 and 125 AD, who expanded it, reversing its orientation and opening a large square with a portico in front of the new temple. </p>

        <!-- History paragraphs -->
        <p>Romantic centre of nineteenth-century Rome, already in the fifteenth century it assumed a very important commercial role due to the presence of many hotels and houses
                inhabited by foreigners, attracted to this area by the representatives of the Spanish and French governments.</p>
        <p>On entering the piazza, you are immediately taken aback by such elegance: the yellow, brownish ochre-coloured buildings, Bernini’s fountain and the celebrated
                Spanish Steps rising up towards the <strong>Church of SS. Trinità dei Monti</strong>, all helping to create a refined, 18th century atmosphere. It is therefore no coincidence that high-fashion brands,
                such as Gucci, Bulgari and Valentino, all have show-piece shops just off the piazza. Home to English poets <strong>Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley</strong>, the world-famous piazza, located at the
                foot of the Pincio Hill, has always been considered both a priceless cultural gem as well as a popular tourist attraction</p>
        <p>The Spanish Steps (1723-26) were built, under the pontificate of Innocent XIII and the direction of the Roman architect Francesco De Santis, to be the meeting place for all citizens.
                On the top of the Steps is the church of SS.Trinità dei Monti, founded in 1495, while in the center of the square is the fountain known as the <strong>"Barcaccia" (1626-29) by Pietro Bernini</strong>,
                father of Gian Lorenzo. The fountain has the shape of a boat with identical prow and stern and is immersed in an oval pool. The edges of the sides are very low, giving
                the impression that the boat is about to sink. On the outside of the bow and stern there are two large coats of arms of Urban VIII with three bees; on the sides of the coats of arms the water
                comes out from false gunners' mouths.</p>

        <!-- History paragraphs -->
        <p>Trevi dominates the plain of Spoleto from its hill and has an urban layout so particular and original that it is referred to as "snail town".
                The visit to the historic centre can start from Via Roma, along which you reach the central <strong>Mazzini</strong>, and from there you can
                climb to the top of the hill where theCathedral of Sant'Emiliano stands out.</p>
        <p>It was in this part of the town, surrounded by walls, that the early medieval town was concentrated, with pebbles and bricks in the paving
                forming various motifs linked to ancient tradition. Also worth seeing are the former convent of San Francesco, which houses a valuable art collection,
                the Civic Art Gallery and the National Museum of the <strong>Civilisation of the Olive</strong>, one of the most renowned typical products, and it was in Trevi that
                the Città dell <strong>Olio Association</strong> was founded. In the lower part of the town you can reach the Piaggia, an area enclosed by medieval walls,
                characterised by numerous evocative streets.</p>
