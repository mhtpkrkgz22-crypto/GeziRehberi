            <p>The construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the Roman Coliseum, began around AD 7 under the Emperor Vespasian.<br>
                 The Coliseum was built in a valley, having dried a small lake that Nero used for the Domus Aurea, between the hills of the Palatine,<br>
                  Esquiline and Celio. The Emperor Titus inaugurated the Colosseum in the year 80, but 2 years later finished the works that included the last floor.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum became the largest Roman amphitheater, with an elliptical structure of 188 meters long, 156 meters wide and 57 meters high. Made in brick<br>
                 and covered with travertine was divided into five levels with a capacity for more than 50,000 people. Its areas were delimited depending on the social class,<br>
                  the closer to the arena they were the greater the rank to which they belonged.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth century, work was done on the settlement and remodeling of the Coliseum, and although during World War II suffered the effects of the attacks,<br>
                 this majestic and imposing monument has become a cultural asset of the city and the world surviving the time and wars.</p>
