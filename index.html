            <p>The construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the <strong>Coliseum</strong>, began around AD 7 under the Emperor Vespasian.<br>
                 The Coliseum was built in a valley, having dried a small lake that Nero used for the <strong>Aurea</strong>, between the hills of the Palatine,<br>
                  Esquiline and Celio. The Emperor Titus inaugurated the Colosseum in the year 80, but 2 years later finished the works that included the last floor.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum became the largest Roman amphitheater, with an elliptical structure of 188 meters long, 156 meters wide and 57 meters high. Made in brick<br>
                 and covered with travertine was divided into five levels with a capacity for more than 50,000 people. Its areas were delimited depending on the social class,<br>
                  the closer to the arena they were the greater the rank to which they belonged.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth century, work was done on the settlement and remodeling of the Coliseum, and although during <strong>World War II</strong> suffered the effects of the attacks,<br>
                 this majestic and imposing monument has become a cultural asset of the city and the world surviving the time and wars.</p>

            <p>“The most beautiful relic of ancient Rome, a temple so well preserved that it appears as the Romans must have seen it in their times,”<br>
                 so described it the<strong>French writer Stendhal</strong> in the 19th century. A source of inspiration for the greatest architects of all ages, its beauty, the harmony<br>
                  of the lines and the perfect geometries have always struck people both in the past and the present.</p>
            <p>The story of one of the best preserved examples of Roman monumental architecture begins in 27 BC, when<strong>Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</strong>,<br>
                 a close friend, son-in-law, and lieutenant to Augustus, commissioned a temple in this area dedicated to “all the gods”. The present building is, however,<br>
                  the result of the radical reconstruction by <strong>between</strong> 118 and 125 AD, who expanded it, reversing its orientation and opening a large square with a portico in front of the new temple. </p>
