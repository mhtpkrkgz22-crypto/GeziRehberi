#GeziRehberi
On this project you can see how you add some list to your page. 
This website is about the İtaly. If you go to Italy, here's a short guide to places to see and restaurants you can go to.
Since it was prepared as a single page, the <br> tag was frequently used to prevent confusion. Additionally, the <mark> tag was used to highlight headings, and the <strong> tag was used to emphasize some important words within paragraphs.
The entire page consists of different lists within the <ol> tag.
